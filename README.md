# *A translation application that I created using the MyMemories and Web Speech APIs.*
> You can make translations between the defined languages, listen to audio with the help of an icon, and your translations with the help of an icon.
- You can access the APIs I use here ; [MyMemory API](https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/spec.php) and [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisUtterance)

> - *If you want to see it in sample sentences related to the words you are translating, you can use the Google Translate API. To do this, you will need to register on Google Cloud Platform, create a new project and activate the Translate API.*
